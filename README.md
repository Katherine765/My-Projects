# My-Projects
This is a collection of most of the games I have made on Python. Feel free to look at them, do whatever you want with them, and give me feedback! You can also recommend new games for me to make. I am a teen who learned python a few years ago and codes on my own every once in a while.

I am probably most proud of my wordle solver and 2048 game, and I am not happy with Flappy Bird.
I know that my commenting and variable names are not  ideal, but I am working on that.
